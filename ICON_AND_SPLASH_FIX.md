# InstantllyCards - Icon and Splash Screen Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. App Icon Not Showing Properly
**Problem**: Users see a generic/placeholder icon instead of the InstantllyCards logo after installing from Play Store.

**Solution Applied**:
- Updated `app.json` to include explicit Android icon configuration
- Changed adaptive icon background from white to dark (`#0F1111`) to match app theme
- Incremented version numbers for new build

### 2. White Flash Screen Before App Loads
**Problem**: Users see a white/blank screen before the InstantllyCards splash screen loads.

**Solution Applied**:
- Changed splash screen background color from `#ffffff` to `#0F1111` (matching your app's dark theme)
- This eliminates the jarring white flash and provides a seamless transition

## Changes Made to app.json

### Before:
```json
{
  "name": "instantllycards",
  "version": "1.0.5",
  "splash": {
    "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
  },
  "android": {
    "versionCode": 4,
    "adaptiveIcon": {
      "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
    }
  }
}
```

### After:
```json
{
  "name": "InstantllyCards",
  "version": "1.0.6",
  "splash": {
    "backgroundColor": "#0F1111"
  },
  "android": {
    "versionCode": 5,
    "icon": "./assets/images/icon.png",
    "adaptiveIcon": {
      "backgroundColor": "#0F1111"
    }
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Rebuild and Deploy
You need to build a new version and upload it to Play Store:

```bash
# Build for production
eas build --platform android --profile production

# After build completes, upload the new AAB file to Play Store Console
```

### 2. Icon Requirements Check
Your current icon files:
- `icon.png`: 22KB (should be 1024x1024px)
- `adaptive-icon.png`: 17KB (should be 1024x1024px) 
- `splash-icon.png`: 17KB

### 3. Verify Icon Quality
Make sure your icons meet these requirements:
- **Main Icon (`icon.png`)**: 1024x1024px, PNG format
- **Adaptive Icon (`adaptive-icon.png`)**: 1024x1024px, PNG format, with transparent background
- **Splash Icon (`splash-icon.png`)**: Should be your logo on transparent background

## Testing

### Before Next Release:
1. Test the app on a clean device/emulator
2. Verify the splash screen shows dark background instead of white
3. Check that the app icon appears correctly in the app drawer
4. Ensure smooth transition from native splash to your React Native splash

### Expected User Experience:
1. User opens app â†’ sees dark splash screen with your logo (no white flash)
2. Seamless transition to your React Native splash screen
3. App loads normally to signup/home screen

## Icon Best Practices for Future Updates

1. **Use high-resolution source files** (at least 1024x1024px)
2. **Test on multiple devices** with different Android versions
3. **Consider different icon shapes** (circle, square, rounded) for adaptive icons
4. **Keep consistent branding** between splash screen and app icon
5. **Use dark theme colors** to match your app's design

## Troubleshooting

If icons still don't appear correctly after the update:
1. Clear cache: `eas build --platform android --clear-cache`
2. Check icon file formats (must be PNG)
3. Verify icon dimensions (should be square, preferably 1024x1024)
4. Test on multiple Android devices/versions

**Next Action**: Build and upload version 1.0.6 to Play Store to fix these issues.
