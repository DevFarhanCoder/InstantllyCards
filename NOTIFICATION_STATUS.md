## 🚨 The ONE Missing Piece

### ❌ Firebase Configuration (`google-services.json`)

**This is the ONLY reason notifications don't work in your APK.**

#### What You Have:
- ✅ Complete notification code (frontend + backend)
- ✅ expo-notifications plugin configured in app.json
- ✅ All notification triggers in place
- ✅ Push token registration system

#### What's Missing:
- ❌ Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) configuration file
- ❌ `google-services.json` from Firebase Console

## 📋 How to Fix (5-Minute Setup)

### Step 1: Get Firebase Configuration
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create project: "InstantllyCards"
3. Add Android app with package: `com.instantllycards.www.twa`
4. Download `google-services.json`

### Step 2: Add to Project
```
InstantllyCards/
├── google-services.json  ← Place it here
├── app.json
├── package.json
└── ...
```

### Step 3: Rebuild APK
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

### Step 4: Test
Install APK on device → Notifications will work! 🎉

## 📱 Notification Types Implemented

### 1. 📨 New Message (Individual Chat)
**Trigger**: User sends you a direct message

**Notification**:
- Title: "{Sender Name}"
- Body: "{Message content}"
- Tap Action: Opens chat with sender

**Backend**: `src/routes/messages.ts` line 77
```typescript
await sendIndividualMessageNotification(...)
```

---

### 2. 👥 Group Message
**Trigger**: Someone sends message in group you're in

**Notification**:
- Title: "{Group Name}"
- Body: "{Sender}: {Message content}"
- Tap Action: Opens group chat

**Backend**: `src/routes/messages.ts` line 207
```typescript
await sendGroupMessageNotification(...)
```

---

### 3. 👤 Contact Joined App
**Trigger**: Someone from your phone contacts installs the app

**Notification**:
- Title: "{Contact Name} joined InstantllyCards"
- Body: "{Contact Name} from your contacts is now on InstantllyCards"
- Tap Action: Opens app

**Backend**: `src/routes/auth.ts` line 154
```typescript
await sendContactJoinedNotification(...)
```

---

### 4. 🆕 Contact Created Card (NEW!)
**Trigger**: Someone from your contacts creates a new card

**Notification**:
- Title: "{Creator Name} created a new card"
- Body: "{Creator Name} created: {Card Title}"
- Tap Action: Opens home feed

**Backend**: `src/routes/cards.ts` (in POST "/" route)
```typescript
await sendCardCreationNotification(...)
```

**How it works**:
1. User creates a card
2. Backend finds all contacts who have this user in their contacts
3. Sends notification to each contact
4. Contacts see notification and can view the new card in their feed

---

### 5. 💳 Card Shared
**Trigger**: Someone sends you a card directly

**Notification**:
- Title: "Card Received"
- Body: "{Sender} sent you a card: {Card Title}"
- Tap Action: Opens card details

**Backend**: `src/routes/cards.ts` line 167
```typescript
await sendCardSharingNotification(...)
```

### 6. 📨 Group Invite
**Trigger**: Someone invites you to a group

**Notification**:
- Title: "Group Invitation"
- Body: "{Inviter} invited you to {Group Name}"
- Tap Action: Opens group details

**Backend**: `src/routes/groups.ts`
```typescript
await sendGroupInviteNotification(...)
```

## 🔄 Complete Notification Flow

### Registration Flow
```
1. User opens app
   ↓
2. _layout.tsx initializes notifications
   ↓
3. notifications-production-v2.ts requests permissions
   ↓
4. Expo generates push token (needs Firebase config)
   ↓
5. Token sent to backend /notifications/register-token
   ↓
6. Backend saves to User.pushToken field
   ✅ User ready to receive notifications
```

### Sending Flow
```
1. Action happens (message sent, card created, etc.)
   ↓
2. Backend route triggers notification function
   ↓
3. Notification function fetches recipient's pushToken
   ↓
4. expo-server-sdk sends to Expo push service
   ↓
5. Expo forwards to FCM (uses google-services.json)
   ↓
6. FCM delivers to user's device
   ✅ User receives notification
```

### Receiving Flow
```
1. FCM delivers notification to device
   ↓
2. Android shows notification in status bar
   ↓
3. User taps notification
   ↓
4. App opens (or comes to foreground)
   ↓
5. handleNotificationTap processes data.type
   ↓
6. App navigates to relevant screen
   ✅ User sees content
```

## 📞 Support

If notifications still don't work after adding `google-services.json`:

1. Check logs in app for:
   - `[REGISTER] Push token obtained successfully`
   - `[BACKEND] Token registered successfully`

2. Verify Firebase setup:
   - Package name matches: `com.instantllycards.www.twa`
   - Cloud Messaging API enabled
   - `google-services.json` is in project root

3. Common issues:
   - Old APK still installed (uninstall before new install)
   - Permissions denied (check device settings)
   - Backend not running or accessible
   - User not logged in (token registers after auth)
