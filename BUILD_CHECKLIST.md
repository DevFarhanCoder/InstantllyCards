### Quick Test: Message Notification
1. Log in on two devices (or two accounts)
2. **Close the app completely** on Device B (swipe away from recent apps)
3. Send a message from Device A to Device B
4. **Expected**: Device B receives push notification
5. Tap notification
6. **Expected**: App opens to chat screen

### Test: Card Creation Notification
1. Make sure User A and User B are contacts
2. **Close app on Device B**
3. User A creates a new card
4. **Expected**: Device B receives "User A created a new card" notification
5. Tap notification
6. **Expected**: App opens to home feed showing the new card

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No notification received"

**Check 1: Permissions**
- Go to: Settings → Apps → InstantllyCards → Notifications
- Make sure notifications are ENABLED

**Check 2: Token Registration**
- Open app → Log in
- Check if you see `✅ [BACKEND] Token registered successfully` in logs
- If not, check your internet connection and backend status

**Check 3: Backend Running**
- Make sure your backend is running: `https://instantlly-cards-backend.onrender.com`
- Test endpoint: `/api/health` or similar

**Check 4: Recipient Has Push Token**
- User must have logged in at least once after installing new APK
- Push token registers after login

### "App crashes on startup"

**Solution**: 
- Uninstall old APK completely
- Clear app data/cache
- Install new APK
- Restart device if needed

### "Token registration failed"

**Check**:
- User is logged in (token registers after authentication)
- Internet connection is active
- Backend is accessible
- Firebase Cloud Messaging API is enabled in Firebase Console

1. ✅ User receives notification when app is **completely closed**
