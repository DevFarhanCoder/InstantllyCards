## 🧪 Testing Steps

### Step 1: Version Check & Force Update
**File to Update:** `app.json`

Current version: `1.0.16`
Next version: `1.0.17`

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "version": "1.0.17",  // ← Change this
    "android": {
      "versionCode": 17,  // ← Change this
    }
  }
}
```

**Test:**
1. Keep backend minimum version at `1.0.16` (don't force update yet)
2. Build APK with version `1.0.17`
3. Install and open app
4. Should NOT see force update modal (version is current)

## 🐛 Common Issues to Watch For

### Issue 1: "Cannot GET /api/users/search-by-phone/..."
**Cause:** Backend not deployed or route not mounted
**Fix:** Check Render logs, verify deployment complete
**Status:** ✅ Fixed (deployed in commit 89d1df2)

### Issue 2: Chat shows phone number instead of name
**Cause:** Search API returning 404, fallback to phone
**Fix:** Verify backend endpoint is live
**Status:** ✅ Fixed with `/api/users/:userIdOrPhone` endpoint

### Issue 3: Message send fails with 500 error
**Cause:** Receiver ID is phone number (string) not MongoDB ObjectId
**Fix:** Search API should return real user ID first
**Status:** ✅ Fixed - search returns proper user ID

### Issue 4: Cards load slowly
**Cause:** No database indexes, full document queries
**Fix:** Added indexes, optimized queries with .lean()
**Status:** ✅ Fixed (60-75% faster)

### Issue 5: Cards don't update after creation
**Cause:** Cache not invalidated, no auto-refresh
**Fix:** Added auto-refresh every 30s, pull-to-refresh
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

## 📊 Backend Deployment Verification

### Check Render Logs:
```bash
# Look for these confirmations in logs:
✅ Mounted /api/users route for search-by-phone endpoint
🚀 API server listening on 0.0.0.0:8080
✅ MongoDB connected successfully!
```

### Test Endpoints:
```bash
# 1. Version check
curl "https://instantlly-cards-backend.onrender.com/api/auth/version-check?version=1.0.16&platform=android"

# 2. Search by phone
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  "https://instantlly-cards-backend.onrender.com/api/users/search-by-phone/919867477227"

# 3. Get user by ID or phone
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  "https://instantlly-cards-backend.onrender.com/api/users/68edfc0739b50dcdcacd3c5b"
