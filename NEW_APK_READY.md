```

### 3. Install on Phone

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Must be a **PHYSICAL DEVICE** (not emulator)!

Steps:
1. **Uninstall old version** (Settings → Apps → InstantllyCards → Uninstall)
2. Enable "Install from unknown sources" (Settings → Security)
3. Open the APK file
4. Tap "Install"
5. Wait for installation to complete

### 4. Grant Permissions

When you open the app for the first time:

**Notification Permission Prompt**:
```
"InstantllyCards would like to send you notifications"
[Don't Allow] [Allow]
```
✅ **TAP "ALLOW"**

### 5. Login

- Enter phone number with country code (e.g., +919867969445)
- Enter password
- Tap "Log in"
- **BE PATIENT**: First login takes 60-90 seconds (Render server waking up)
- Watch progress: "Waking up server..." → "Authenticating..." → Success!

### 6. Verify Token Registration

While app is installing, connect phone to computer and watch logs:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\user3\Documents\App\InstantllyCards"
npx react-native log-android
```

**Look for these SUCCESS messages**:
```
🚀 Initializing app systems...
📱 [REGISTER] Starting push notification registration...
📱 [REGISTER] Checking notification permissions...
✅ [REGISTER] Notification permissions granted
📱 [REGISTER] Getting Expo push token...
🎉 [REGISTER] Push token obtained successfully: ExponentPushToken[xxx...]
💾 [REGISTER] Token saved to AsyncStorage
🔄 [BACKEND] User not authenticated - storing token as pending
💾 [BACKEND] Token saved as pending, will register after login
```

**After login**:
```
🔍 [PENDING] Checking for pending push token...
📲 [PENDING] Found pending token, registering now...
🔄 [BACKEND] User authenticated, sending token to server...
✅ [BACKEND] Token registered successfully
🗑️ [BACKEND] Cleared pending token
```

### 7. Check Database

After logging in, run this to verify token is saved:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\user3\Documents\App\Instantlly-Cards-Backend"
PS C:\Users\user3\Documents\App\Instantlly-Cards-Backend> node test-push-notification.js
🔌 Connecting to MongoDB...
✅ Connected to MongoDB
❌ No users with push tokens found!
💡 Make sure at least one user has logged in to register their push token
PS C:\Users\user3\Documents\App\Instantlly-Cards-Backend> 
```

**Expected Output**:
```
✅ Found user: Mohammad Farhan
   Phone: +919867969445
   Push Token: ExponentPushToken[xxx...]
   Platform: android
   Token Updated: 2025-10-06T...
```

### 8. Test Notifications

Send a test notification:
```powershell
node test-push-notification.js
```

**Expected Output**:
```
✅ Found 1 users with push tokens
📤 Sending test notification to: Mohammad Farhan (+919867969445)
✅ Notification sent successfully!
```

**On your phone**: You should receive a notification! 🎉

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "App won't install"
- Make sure old version is completely uninstalled

- Make sure you're on physical device, not emulator
- Try logout and login again

### "Test notification fails"

2. Check backend logs on Render dashboard
3. Verify permissions in phone settings
4. Try logout/login again
