# 🚀 Quick Fix Summary - Mobile APK Sign-In

## What Was Wrong?
Mobile app login timing out with message:
> "Server is taking longer than usual..."

**Why?** Render free tier sleeps after 15 min → takes 50-90 seconds to wake up → old timeout was only 8 seconds ❌

## What's Fixed?
✅ Extended timeout to **90 seconds** (handles Render wake-up)  
✅ Better progress indicators ("Waking up server..." with %)  
✅ Clear error messages explaining Render cold start  
✅ Retry mechanism with warmup state reset  
✅ Compatible timeout method (`AbortController`)  

## How To Use Now

### 1️⃣ Build New APK
```bash
cd InstantllyCards

# Production APK
eas build --profile production --platform android

# Or development build for testing
eas build --profile development --platform android
```

### 2️⃣ Install on Device
- Download APK from Expo build
- Install on your Android device
- Allow installation from unknown sources if needed

### 3️⃣ Sign In
**First time** (after server sleeps 15+ min):
- Enter phone number & password
- Tap "Log in"
- See: "Waking up server... (10%)"
- **WAIT 60-90 seconds** ⏰ (be patient!)
- Progress bar updates: 10% → 60% → 70% → 85% → 100%
- ✅ Logged in!

**Next times** (server still awake):
- Enter credentials
- Tap "Log in"
- **1-3 seconds** ⚡
- ✅ Logged in!

## 💡 Pro Tip: Keep Server Awake (FREE)

**Use UptimeRobot** to ping server every 10 min:
1. Go to https://uptimerobot.com (free account)
2. Add monitor:
   - URL: `https://instantlly-cards-backend.onrender.com/api/health`
   - Interval: 10 minutes
3. Server never sleeps = **instant login every time!** 🎉

## Troubleshooting

### Still timing out?
1. Check internet connection
2. Wait full 90 seconds (Render can be slow)
3. Check Render dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com
4. Test backend: `curl https://instantlly-cards-backend.onrender.com/api/health`

### Wrong credentials error?
- ✅ Use country code (+91 for India)
- ✅ Check phone number is correct
- ✅ Verify password
- ✅ Account exists (sign up if new)

### Network error?
- ✅ Check WiFi/mobile data
- ✅ Try different network
- ✅ Disable VPN if active
